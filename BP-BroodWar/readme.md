# BP-Brood War

A bot building interface with BP! Built using BWMirror and BWAPI.

## Slowing down the game for BP
BP is not yet performant enough to run seamlessly with StarCraft in real-time. Change the value of the `speed_override` parameter in the `bwapi.ini` file in your Starcraft/bwapi-data folder to something around 100 (that is, 100ms per game frame).
